   - Distribution of sales by genre
   - Top-selling games and publishers
   - Correlation between game features (e.g., genre, platform) and sales

## Power BI Tools:
- Get Data: Import the video game sales data into Power BI using the appropriate connector.
- Power Query Editor: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
- Visualizations:
   - Stacked Bar Charts: To visualize sales distribution across different regions, platforms, and genres.
   - Stacked Column Charts: To compare sales performance of different games or publishers.
   - Line Charts: To analyze sales trends over time.
   - Area Charts: To visualize sales trends for multiple regions or platforms.
   - Ribbon Charts: To represent the distribution of sales across different categories.
   - Card: To display key metrics (e.g., total sales, top-selling games).
   - Tables: To view detailed game information.
   - Treemap: To visualize the distribution of sales by genre and platform.
   - Filtering: To drill down into specific game segments.
   - Format Pane: To customize the appearance of visualizations.
